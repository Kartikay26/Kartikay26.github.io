title: How to make a Todo App? (part 1)
---

In this series of blog posts, I will be making a simple todo web app + a mobile app (in flutter). This is so that, by making a todo app, as a very simple example, I can explain to you all the basic things you need to know to make any app yourself. We will be making this app with an increasing complexity in each blog post. In the first one, we will start with a JQuery frontend-only app that uses the browser's session storage. Then in the next one we will use a backend made in Flask, with bcrypt authentication and SQLite database, and we will later add to it NodeJS, MongoDB, PassportJS, Flutter, React, Redux, GraphQL, ML, Blockchain, Quantum Computing, and all the latest buzzwords! :D (After all, it is 2019 and it is no longer acceptable in modern society to use a todo app that doesn't have atleast a Neural Network in it.)
All the code will be in a github repo, so you can follow the development at any step.

In the first post, I'll explain all the terms like Frontend, Backend, API, JSON, etc, so even beginners will have no trouble understanding any of this.

# The structure of any app

## The backend, frontend, and the middle-end

To build an app we'll first have to understand how different parts of an app work together. An app consists of  two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend code is the part that is responsible for displaying stuff  on your screen and managing the logic of user actions. The backend is the part which handles the "business logic" of your app and stores all the data. The backend is usually on the server side and the frontend on the client's computer. The thing that links the Frontend and the Backend is called _the API_ [^1]. The Frontend code connects to the backend and sends it some data in a response.

The frontend is made using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and React. The backend can be made in Python using the Flask framework or in Javacript with NodeJS (using Express) etc. The database can be either on the same server as the web server (running on a different process and port number) or it can be on a seperate server if you're making a large app. Databases come in two flavours, SQL databases (MySql, SQLite, etc.) and the new, shiny, NoSQL databases (MongoDB etc). You may have studied SQL earlier, it is a way to query relational databases. In the SQL-based databases, you need to have a proper data format defined using tables beforehand. But in the NoSQL databases you can simply use the database as a large JSON object, and forget about tables and SQL and stuff. (I've explained JSON below, don't worry if you don't understand it now).


## The frontend

The frontend, for a web app is coded in HTML+CSS+Javascript.

- The HTML is purely Markup, it provides only the content of the web page. CSS is decoration, it styles the web page, and the JavaScript provides code that actually has the logic.
- To make it easier to write code in the frontend, we have some libraries there too, for example JQuery. It is a javascript library that provides certain common functionality like adding elements, hiding things, making transitions, etc.
- Bootstrap is a library for CSS that makes it easier to make good looking websites. It provides predefined classes that lets us make responsive websites.
- There are certain frameworks like React which make it possible to create much better frontend code, with components and a "reactive" coding style but I'll not explain that here. (we'll meet React in a later post...)
- In Android, the task of HTML+CSS is taken up by XML and JavaScript code is replaced with Java.
- However we also have another framework for App development called _Flutter_, which is quite similar to React, and it makes it much easier to write Android code! It is cross platform too so the code will run on iOS as well. It's quite a cool thing, and we'll cover that too in a later blog post.

## The middle-end (API)

(Haha, of course, the middle is not an end!) In a web api, all the communication is done over HTTP, so that means the resuests will be sent as individual GET and POST requests [^2]. What that means, in simple terms is that we will be sending requests to the server in mainly two ways, a GET request to fetch some data from the server (like viewing some content), or a POST request, to send some new data to the server (or to change the server's state).

All the data transfer that happens between the server and client is done in a particular format called the _JSON format_ (JavaScript Object Notation). Let us first see how data is represented in this format.

## JSON Format

The JSON format is a lightweight data description format. It is a text format and is human readable (as opposed to a binary format). This format is used because it is very convinient to pass around in a web app to and from the server. It can be read and understood by the developer easily, can be parsed by the language easily, etc. In JSON, we can have  the following types of any data, _string, number, bool, null, array, and object_.

<center> <img src="/assets/2_json_types.jpg" width="100%"> </center>

The data types string, number, and bool[^3] are basic data types. The `null` type is used to show that there is no data associated with that field. The only notable point here is that the types Object and Array can contain other data types, even themselves. This means that you can have infinitely complex data types, with arbitrary nesting, Array within an Array, Array of Objects, Objects containing Arrays containing Objects etc.

Some sample JSON data for our todo app:

```json
[
    {
        "todoid": 1,
        "title": "Get notes for endsem from teacher",
        "finished": true,
        "timestamp": 1558859316.3211691,
        "tags": ["study", "endsem"],
    },
    {
        "todoid": 2,
        "title": "Solve problem 225C on codeforces",
        "finished": false,
        "timestamp": 1558864813.0850985,
        "tags": ["codeforces"],
    },
]
```

This could've even been written without spaces in a compressed form like:

```json
[{"todoid": 1,"title": "Get notes for endsem from teacher",
"finished": true,"timestamp": 1558859316.3211691,"tags": [
"study", "endsem"],},{"todoid": 2,"title":
"Solve problem 225C on codeforces","finished": false,"timestamp":
1558864813.0850985,"tags": ["codeforces"],},]
```

## Back to the Backend

Our app communicates with the API by sending it GET and POST rquests on certain URLs, which are called _API endpoints_ or _routes_. These URLs can be like `/alltodos, /newtodo, /markAsDone` etc. The server itself is accessed using an ip address or domain name like `http://best_todo_app_ever.com/alltodos` or `http://12.34.56.78/alltodos` 

In our todo app, you can imagine the conversation between the server and client like this: (the parts in square brackets are the english translation)

```
client:

--> GET /todoDetails?id=2

[the request can also contain parameters in the URL 
itself, like the id=2 here]

server:

--> {"todoid": 2,"title": "Solve problem 225C on 
    codeforces","finished": false,"timestamp": 
    1558864813.0850985,"tags": ["codeforces"],}

----------------------------------------------------------

client:

--> POST /newtodo
    json data: {"title": "finish math assignment", 
    "finished": false, "timestamp": 1558865911.8238328,}

    ["add a new todo with the data I sent you"]

server:

--> OK, todo added. Here's the new todoid: 3

----------------------------------------------------------
```

Note that in this model, only the client can initiate communication with the server by sending it a request. The server cannot send data to the client at an arbitrary time by itself. That is only possible with the new websockets technology, not with standard HTTP. If the client wants to check for new data on the server, it must do polling in the background.

## The web server

Okay, so now how will we make this API, and how will the client access it? To make a web API like this, you will need a software to listen for HTTP requests. This kind of software is called a _web server_, and luckily, it is already present in the standard libraries of many languages so you won't have to implement it yourself. What we will have to implement are simply functions that handle each of the API endpoints, or routes. For example, _Flask_, a python library allows us to create an API like this quite easily. Let us say we want to create an API with two endpoints, `/a` and `/b`, one which handles GET and one that handles POST. In flask it is as simple as this:

```py
from flask import *
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/a", methods=["GET"])
def handle_a():
    # do stuff to handle request 'a'
    # get query parameters in request.args
    return response

@app.route("/b", methods=["POST"])
def handle_b():
    # do stuff to handle request 'b'
    # process some json data from request.json
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

There is very minimal boilerplate code, just 3-4 lines, and we simply have to declare the functions to handle the two routes and we can return the response directly from those functions. Flask makes it really easy to make web apps like this[^4].

All our buisness logic lives in these functions, we can connect to our database from here, process the data, do whatever we want.

NodeJS and Express is similar to Flask, but they are more popular because they are significantly faster than Flask's default server.

We'll start making the app in [part 2](/2019/05/26/todo_app_pt2)!

[^1]: Actually, the concept of an API is more general than this, but I'm only explaining API in the context of a web API here. Check out wikipedia for the more general definition.

[^2]: You can get more info about [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) at the awesome documentation at Mozilla Developer network. Check out [HTTP data flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#HTTP_flow) and an [HTTP example session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Session) and [HTTP Request Methods ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) (like GET and POST).

[^3]: A Number in JavaScript is actually always a IEEE floating point number, so there are no seperate float and int data types.
