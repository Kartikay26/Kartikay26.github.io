title: How to make a Todo App? (part 3 -- flask)
published: false
---

In this post we'll create an API for our app, in Flask, so that our data isn't stored on the client side and is instead sent to the server each time. We'll use the same implementation of the frontend that we had made last time, we'll just change some of the JavaScript code.

I will assume you understand basic python code. Even if you don't understand everything like the `@decorator` syntax, the code should be easy enough to follow along.

## Installing python and flask

The easiest and best way, in my opinion, to get python is through the Anaconda (or Miniconda) distribution. On linux you sometimes have python installed beforehand but usually it is the system python and it can mess things up when installing new packages. Anaconda does a really good job at seperating the python you're using from the one required by the system and reduces a lot of headaches. So assuming you've got Anaconda (or miniconda) with python 3 installed, you can simply do 

```bash
$ pip install flask
```

and you'll get flask installed for you in about a minute. Let's not mess with virtual envioronments just yet.

(If you're on the default system python you'll have to do either `pip install -u flask` for user level install or `sudo pip install flask` for the system level install. Also you'll have to mess with different versions of python and pip, that is why I said Anaconda is the best idea.)

## A basic application in flask

Once you have Flask installed, you can run this code to test if it works:

```py
from flask import *
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello World"

app.run()
```

Simply save this as `main.py` and run this with `python main.py`. You should see the server start up and report that it is running at url `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or something. That means the server is listening for connections on `localhost (127.0.0.1)` on `port 5000`. If you open that link in a web browser, you will see just `"Hello World"` written there. Localhost basically refers to the same machine, and a port number is a number between `0-65535` that the application can run on. By default it chooses `5000` arbitrarily, but we can set it later.

What just happened here?

1. You created a Flask App object called `app`. What is `__name__` is irrelevant for now, just consider that line to be boilerplate code. What you need to know is just that the `app` object will be configured according to us and when `app.run` is called, it will start up the default server to listen on some web address for requests and respond to them accordingly.

2. We have added one _route_ to the app object, the route at url `"/"`. That means it will be accessed as the home page of our app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (see the last `/`?) When a web browser connects to ther server at `127.0.0.1:5000` and asks to display the URL `/`, the web server will understand this request and call the function `home` associated with this route, which simply returns `"Hello World"` to the browser.

    We added this route by using a _decorator_, `@app.route("/")`. Decorators in python are just _Higher-Order functions_, and python provides the `@` syntax to work with them. This just means that they are special functions that can act on other functions. Here the decorator `app.route("/")` is acting on the function `home`, adding it to the list of routes in `app`.

3. The browser interprets the incoming text as HTML and displays it on the screen. Although we can use flask as a proper web server and have it return HTML to the browser and make proper websites with it, we're not covering that here. Here we'll just use Flask for the API and do the coding for the frontend seperately. That way you could even have your frontend made in a different technology, say React and have it connect to the Flask API.

## Using Flask to send and recieve JSON data

Sending and recieving JSON data with Flask is pretty easy. You can send JSON data by returning a simple python object, by calling `flask.jsonify` function on it. So, to send a data containing a text, say, we could do:

```py
@app.route("/getText")
def text():
    return jsonify({"text": "Hello World"})
```

The jsonify function converts a python dict to a json object. Python dicts are very similar to JSON objects anyways. It also sets the correct _headers_ on the response object so that the browser interprets it correctly as JSON data. Now if you make this change and restart your server[^1] and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/getText`, you will see the JSON data. It will additionally be in monospace font because the browser now knows this is JSON from the header and not normal text.

We can also test this with a command line utility called `curl`[^2], which is present on most linux systems.

```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/getText
{
  "text": "Hello World"
}
```

To recieve JSON data you can do this:

```py
@app.route("/recvjson", methods=["POST"])
def recv():
    data = request.json
    return "recieved some json data: " + str(type(data)) + " " + str(data)
```

Okay, so assuming this thing works, how do we test it? How can I show you that when I will send it some data, the data will actually go into `request.json`?

To test this, we have two methods.

First, You can use `curl` to send it some data like this:

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"num":123}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/recvjson
recieved some json data: <class 'dict'> {'num': 123}
```

We see that the server automatically parsed the json data and stored it in `response.json` as a python `dict`. We needed to set the `-H` flag in the curl command to set the `Content-Type` header without which the server wouldn't understand that this is JSON data, and the `-d '{"num":123}'` flag specifies the actual data to send to the URL.

Second, you can use a software called POSTMAN that is specifically made for testing API's and allows you to test all kinds of requests with a GUI.

## We need a database!

Now, we need to actually store the todos on a backend. You may think that we can do it by creating a global variable `todos` and use it as a database to store the todos. If you test this approach on your machine you may find that it works too. **BUT!** This is a trap! It looks like it will work, but it actually doesn't. Why?

This is because when the Flask code is deployed on a server, many worker processes will be created. This means that the code you write will be duplicated a number of times, to provide optimum performance and to handle multiple clients at once. That means that a global variable will actually be accessed by multiple threads at once and may be susceptible to *[Race conditions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition)*. Depending on the deployment procedure, it may also happen that the global variable splits up and different threads see a different global variable!

> **This means that you should not use global variables in Flask code.**

So, what should we do instead? We need to use a database to solve the problem. A proper database has properties like  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (together called *[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science))*) built into it, that solve the problems accociated with multiple processes accessing it at once.[^3]

In part one we've already discussed that databases come in two flavours, the SQL databases and the NoSQL databases. In this post let us check out a database called SQLite. It is a very simple database system, written in C, and comes prepackaged with python. It simply stores the data in a file, and does not need a server process. All you need is an `import sqlite3` to start using it. (In contrast, MySQL is quite difficult to set up and needs a seperate server process, and is a bit tricky to interface with python.)

To use it, first of all install a software called `SQLite browser` in ubuntu (It's avaiable in the ubuntu store). Using this software you'll be able to create tables easily with a GUI form. So create a new database file called `todos.db` and create it with something like the following fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "todos" (
    "id"	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "title"	TEXT NOT NULL,
    "finished"  BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    "timestamp"	INTEGER
)
```

To connect to the db, we can use some [helpful functions](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/sqlite3/) given in the flask documentation which makes it very simple to query the database with a get_db() function. I've further modified it a bit to also support update and insert queries. Check out the updated code on [github](http://github.com/kartikay26/todo).

```py
import time
import sqlite3
from flask import *

DATABASE = 'todos.db'

# following code from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/sqlite3/
# with a bit of modification

def get_db():
    [...]

@app.teardown_appcontext
def close_connection(exception):
    [...]

def query_db(query, args=(), one=False):
    [...]

########################################################################

# GET /alltodos -- gets JSON data of all todos in database
@app.route("/allTodos")
def allTodos():
    data = query_db("select * from todos")
    resp = [dict(x) for x in data]
    return jsonify(resp)

# POST /addtodo {"title": title} -- adds new todo with given title
@app.route("/addTodo", methods=["POST"])
def addTodo():
    title = request.json['title']
    finished = 0
    timestamp = time.time()
    next_id = query_db("select max(id) from todos", one=True)[0]
    next_id = 1 if next_id is None else next_id+1
    query_db("insert into todos values (?,?,?,?)",
                [next_id, title, finished, timestamp])
    return jsonify({"success": True, "todoid": next_id})

# POST /toggleFinished  {"todoid": num} -- toggles "finished" field
#           of todo with given todoid
@app.route("/toggleFinished", methods=["POST"])
def toggleFinished():
    todoid = request.json['todoid']
    cur_fin = query_db("select finished from todos where id=?", [todoid], one=True)[0]
    query_db("update todos set finished=? where id=?", [not cur_fin, todoid])
    return jsonify({"success": True})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

You can test this API with curl or postman, I'll leave it upto you. Now let's quickly implement the frontend for this.

## AJAX and the Frontend

The plan is, we'll use some parts of the frontend from the last post, and implement a new system to get data from the backend and display it. We'll keep the same implementation of `display_todo`, we'll add a new system to _refresh all the todos_ on each change, and we'll modify `add_todo` and `todo_checked`. It's certainly not the most optimal way to do it, but it is the simplest for sure.

First, to connect the frontend to the flask project, place it in a folder caled templates as "frontend.html" and add a route for the home page. If we don't do this, we'll have trouble with something called CORS.

```py
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("frontend.html")
```

Okay, so let's first begin with the `refresh_todos()` which is also used to load new todos in the beginning. _So, well, How do we get the data from the server?_ To do this, we use a mechanism called AJAX, which we can do quite easily with JQuery. AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML. That is because initially, when it was made, it made use of XML. Today the technique still remains in use but the use of XML has been replaced by JSON. What this technique allows us to do, is to fetch some data from a server in the background and still continue to run JS code while the data is being fetched.

To do this, let's just search Google for the correct syntax. We find this is one of the ways to use it:

```js
$.ajax(url, [settings]).done(callbackFn);

// settings is an optional argument
// with options like "method", "data", "contentType" etc.

// callbackFn is a function like 
//   function (data, status) {
//      [...]
//   }
```

We can also add a `.fail` callback to handle errors. So let's try GET'ting `/allTodos` and displaying them.

```js
function refresh_todos() {
    $.ajax("http://127.0.0.1:5000/allTodos").done(function (data, status) {
        console.log(data);
    }).fail(function (data, status) {
        console.log("Error in refresh_todos:", data.statusText, status);
    });
}
```

All right! There we see our data on the console! Now let's just display it on the screen.!

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.7.png"> </center>

```js
function refresh_todos() {
    $.ajax("http://127.0.0.1:5000/allTodos").done(function (data, status) {
        for (var todo of data) {
            display_todo(todo.id, todo.title, todo.finished);
        }
    }).fail(function (data, status) {
        console.log("Error in refresh_todos:", data.statusText, status);
    });
}
```

As soon as we do that, we see the data added manually into the DB displayed on the screen. If you want something like a real-time update on todos, you could even make it refresh every 2 seconds. It is as simple as that:

```js
// periodically refresh todos every 2 seconds
setInterval(refresh_todos, 2000);
```

As soon as we do this, we notice a bug! The todos are increasing every 2 seconds! This is because out refresh_todos function isn't clearing the list that's already there. So let's fix that! Just add this line in the `.done()` callback:

```js
$("#todo-list").empty();
```

But as we don't really need to refresh anything needlessly here, we'll not add the `setInterval` function. We may need something like this, say, if there's some online competition and we want to refresh the scoreboard everytime. Right now let's only refresh the data if something changes.

Now, the `toggle_todo` and the `add_todo` functions become reallly simple to write.

```js
function add_todo() {
    var title = $("#new_todo").val();
    var todo_id = $(".todo").length + 1;
    $.ajax("http://127.0.0.1:5000/addTodo", {
        "method": "POST",
        "contentType": "application/json",
        "data": JSON.stringify({"title": title}),
    }).done(function () {
        refresh_todos();
    })
}

function todo_checked(idx) {
    $.ajax("http://127.0.0.1:5000/toggleFinished", {
        "method": "POST",
        "contentType": "application/json",
        "data": JSON.stringify({"todoid": idx}),
    }).done(function () {
        refresh_todos();
    })
}
```

That's it! We're done! Upon testing, everything is working perfectly. Now just for fun lets change the display function a bit to take the whole todo object instead and also display the time the todo was added on. We no longer need HTML id's in these todo's so that makes the code a bit cleaner.

```js
// in refresh_todos:
// ...
for (var todo of data) {
    display_todo(todo);
}
// ...


// display_todo
function display_todo(todo) {            
    $("#todo-list").append(
        $("<li/>").append(
            $(`<div class='todo'/>`).append(
                $("<div class='todo-title'/>").text(todo.title)
                    .css("text-decoration", todo.finished ? "line-through" : "none")
            ).append(
                $(`<input type='checkbox' class='todo-check' ${todo.finished ? "checked" : ""}>`)
                    .on("change",
                        function () {
                            todo_checked(todo.id);
                        }
                    )
            ).append(
                $(`<small> Added on: ${new Date(todo.timestamp * 1e3).toLocaleString()}</small>`)
            )
        )
    );
}
```

It works perfect now! Even the code is a lot cleaner than before.
We'll just modify the CSS a bit, and here's our final app:

```css
.todo-title {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 200px;
}
.todo {
    height: 58px;
}
.todo small{
    display: block;
    color: #dbdbdb82;
    font-style: italic;
}
```

[^1]: You can set debug mode to ON in Flask, which will, among other helpful things, reload your server automatically when your code changes, auto-format your json data, etc. To do this just change the last line to `app.run(debug=True)`.
[^2]: Install with `sudo apt install curl`
[^3]: We could also have used Redis (which is sortof like a temporary database in RAM) but it isn't made for storing the database permanently in disk, which we want here.
