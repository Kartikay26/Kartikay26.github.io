title: How to make a Todo App? (part 2 -- jquery)

# Let's make an app!

In this part, we will be using JQuery and the browser's session storage to create a client-side todo app. We'll add the backend next time. :)

## The HTML

First we start out with just the basic components of our app in an HTML file

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>To-Do App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="main">
    <div id="heading">
      <h1>To-Do's</h1>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="todo">
          <input type="checkbox" class="todo-check">
          <span class="todo-title">
            Get Stuff Done
          </span>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="todo">
          <input type="checkbox" class="todo-check">
          <span class="todo-title">
            Get Stuff Done - 2
          </span>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="new">
      <input type="text" id="new_todo">
      <button>+</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

It looks right now like this:

## The CSS

We've added those div's with the id's and classes so that we can later add CSS to style those elements individually. We could have used a CSS library like bootstrap, that provides a lot of predefined classes for us to use. But there's an even simpler alternative, called [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css/), that just requires us to add _one line of code_!

We'll just add this line to the `<head>`:

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kognise/water.css@latest/dist/dark.min.css'>
```

Now it looks like:

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.2.png"> </center>

Much better, I think!

## The Javascript

We can focus on the rest of the styling later on, but right now let's just get all the JQuery code to work. First add JQuery from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

The JQuery library basically provides us a single function called `$` that is just magic. It can do a lot of stuff. with just this one function.

For Example:

```js
// select an HTML DOM element with id #new_todo:
$("#new_todo")
// select all elements with class todo-title and set the style to color: red
$(".todo-title").css("color", "red");
// find all div elements, create a new <p>Hello world</p> element and append it to all of them
$("div").append( $("<p>Hello world</p>") );
```

If you want to test how all this works and experiment with this a bit, open up the chrome JS console on the web page we're making with Ctrl+Shift+J and test any of this code.

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.3.png"> </center>

Now, to make our "+" button work, we will add an `onclick` attribute to the button:

```html
<button onclick="add_todo()">+</button>
```

This will call the `add_todo()` function in javascript whenever the button is pressed. We'll now make this function in javascript that reads text from the input box and then adds it to the list.

```js
function add_todo() {
  var title = $("#new_todo").val();
  $("#todo-list").append(
    $("<li/>").append(
      $("<div class='todo'/>").append(
        $("<input type='checkbox' class='todo-check'>")
      ).append(
        $("<span class='todo-title'/>").text(title)
      )
    )
  );
  $("#new_todo").val("");
}
```

The first line uses JQuery's selector syntax to select the element with id `new_todo` and gets its value. The next lines find the `#todo_list` element, and adds a new todo element to it and sets its text equal to the value we had found earlier. Then we clear the text box with the last line.


We just test this code, and right now, it is working as intended.

If you're still confused, experiment with this in your own JS console. You can also look up JQuery's own documentation at its official website. It has a lot of helpful examples.

## Implementing the session storage

Right now, our app does not have any data storage. As soon as you will refresh the page, all your todos will be lost! We need some way to store these To-Do's so that the user can open our app at any time and the To-do's remain there.

We could store the To-do's on a database in our server (and we will do that later), but right now we're gonna store the data directly on the client's computer. To do this we will use the "session storage" in the browser
