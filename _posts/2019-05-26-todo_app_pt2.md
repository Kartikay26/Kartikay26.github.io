title: How to make a Todo App? (part 2 -- jquery)
---

# Let's make an app!

In this part, we will be using JQuery and the browser's session storage to create a client-side todo app. We'll add the backend next time. :)

## The HTML

First we start out with just the basic components of our app in an HTML file

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>To-Do App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="main">
    <div id="heading">
      <h1>To-Do's</h1>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="todo">
          <input type="checkbox" class="todo-check">
          <span class="todo-title">
            Get Stuff Done
          </span>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="todo">
          <input type="checkbox" class="todo-check">
          <span class="todo-title">
            Get Stuff Done - 2
          </span>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="new">
      <input type="text" id="new_todo">
      <button>+</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

It looks right now like this:

## The CSS

We've added those div's with the id's and classes so that we can later add CSS to style those elements individually. We could have used a CSS library like bootstrap, that provides a lot of predefined classes for us to use. But there's an even simpler alternative, called [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css/), that just requires us to add _one line of code_!

We'll just add this line to the `<head>`:

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kognise/water.css@latest/dist/dark.min.css'>
```

Now it looks like:

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.2.png"> </center>

Much better, I think!

## The Javascript

We can focus on the rest of the styling later on, but right now let's just get all the JQuery code to work. First add JQuery from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

The JQuery library basically provides us a single function called `$` that is just magic. It can do a lot of stuff. with just this one function.

For Example:

```js
// select an HTML DOM element with id #new_todo:
$("#new_todo")
// select all elements with class todo-title and set the style to color: red
$(".todo-title").css("color", "red");
// find all div elements, create a new <p>Hello world</p> element and append it to all of them
$("div").append( $("<p>Hello world</p>") );
```

If you want to test how all this works and experiment with this a bit, open up the chrome JS console on the web page we're making with Ctrl+Shift+J and test any of this code.

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.3.png"> </center>

Now, to make our "+" button work, we will add an `onclick` attribute to the button:

```html
<button onclick="add_todo()">+</button>
```

This will call the `add_todo()` function in javascript whenever the button is pressed. We'll now make this function in javascript that reads text from the input box and then adds it to the list.

```js
function add_todo() {
  var title = $("#new_todo").val();
  $("#todo-list").append(
    $("<li/>").append(
      $("<div class='todo'/>").append(
        $("<input type='checkbox' class='todo-check'>")
      ).append(
        $("<span class='todo-title'/>").text(title)
      )
    )
  );
  $("#new_todo").val("");
}
```

The first line uses JQuery's selector syntax to select the element with id `new_todo` and gets its value. The next lines find the `#todo_list` element, and adds a new todo element to it and sets its text equal to the value we had found earlier. Then we clear the text box with the last line.


We just test this code, and right now, it is working as intended.

If you're still confused, experiment with this in your own JS console. You can also look up JQuery's own documentation at its official website. It has a lot of helpful examples.

You can try to add the rest of the features like crossing out To-Do's and add a bit of styling yourself. If you get stuck check out the code on github. Here's what it looks like once we've done that:

<center> <img src="/assets/ss1.5.png"> </center>

The code I've implemented for checking the To-Do's does something like this. To each div containing a todo it assigns an id contianing the todoid, like `#todo-3` if the todoid was 3. Then, to each checkbox it adds a callback `onclick` function that uses jquery to find the asociated element and add a css style, `text-decoraation: line-through` to the text, crossing it out.

```js
function todo_checked(idx) {
  if ($(`#todo-${idx} input`).is(":checked")) {
    $(`#todo-${idx} div`).css("text-decoration", "line-through");
  } else {
    $(`#todo-${idx} div`).css("text-decoration", "none");
  }
}

// and add this event handler to each checkbox while creating a todo

//......
[stuff].append(
  $("<input type='checkbox' class='todo-check'>").on("change",
    function () {
      todo_checked(todo_id);
    }
  )
)
//......
```

This style of coding is called the **"imperative style"**. In this style, although it is very clear what each function has to do, but if we are not careful, the entire codebase will become Spaghetti code and it will end up being a big mess. (I think this code is also not very far from being that mess! XD)

To avoid this, we now prefer a different coding style called **Reactive programming**, which is of course named after Facebook's open source JS framework called React. In Reactive programming we follow functional principles and make the code more object oriented. This makes the code far more organised and maintainable, although it is a bit overwhelming to get started with. We'll see how to use React in part 4.

## Implementing the session storage

Right now, our app does not have any data storage. As soon as you will refresh the page, all your todos will be lost! We need some way to store these To-Do's so that the user can open our app at any time and the To-do's remain there.

We could store the To-do's on a database in our server (and we will do that later), but right now we're gonna store the data directly on the client's computer. To do this we will use the "session storage" in the browser.

We could do this in two ways:

1. As soon as the user enters a todo, append it to a global JSON object that stores all the todos. When the user clicks a checkbox, update the JSON accordingly. After each change store the JSON in the session storage. When the page is loaded for the first time, read the session storage and update the displayed list.

2. Whenever any change is made by the user, update it into the JSON object and re-render everything on the screen.

Approach 2 is much simpler, and more elegant. What is wrong with approach 1? It violates one of the fundamental principles of programming, the principle of **single source of truth**. What this principle says is, if there is a some data in the system, there should be only one true source where it should come from, that we should always trust. In the second way, we only trust the single JSON object that we have. When we violate this principle, we end up with two or more pieces of state which we have to work hard to keep in sync and then you will also end up repeating code, violating the even bigger principle of **DRY** (*don't repeat yourself*).

There's a problem with approach 2 though, you will either re-render the whole page (which takes computational power and may flicker the screen), or you will have to compare the parts you want to render and then update only the changed parts, which is a quite complex task in itself. The last approach is the one taken by React.

Right now, we'll just go with approach 1 as this is just a small project. We probably won't have much trouble keeping the state in sync with what's shown on screen for such a small app.

We start with a global array, and then update the code in add_todo, and also seperate out the part that actually renderes the todo to the screen

```js
todo_data = [];

function display_todo(id, title){
  $("#todo-list").append(
    $("<li/>").append(
      $(`<div id='todo-${id}' class='todo'/>`).append(
        $("<div class='todo-title'/>").text(title)
      ).append(
        $("<input type='checkbox' class='todo-check'>").on("change",
          function () {
            todo_checked(id);
          }
        )
      )
    )
  );
}

function add_todo() {
  var title = $("#new_todo").val();
  var todo_id = $(".todo").length + 1;
  display_todo(todo_id, title);
  todo_data.append({"todo_id": todo_id, "title": title, "finished": false});
  sessionStorage.setItem("todo_data", JSON.stringify(todo_data));
  $("#new_todo").val("");
}
```

The line `sessionStorage.setItem("todo_data", JSON.stringify(todo_data));` actually uses the session storage and adds a new key value pair. We need to store the data in a string format, so we use `JSON.stringify()` function to do that. The opposite is `JSON.parse()` which converts a JSON string into a JS Object.

First let's see if this part is working, we'll test it from the console.

```js
> sessionStorage.getItem("todo_data")
// "[{"todo_id":1,"title":"first","finished":false},{"todo_id":2,"title":"second","finished":false},{"todo_id":3,"title":"third","finished":false}]"
```

Okay so it is storing the item already. Now we just need a load function and we'll be done!

```js
function load_todos(){
  todo_data = sessionStorage.getItem("todo_data");
  todo_data = JSON.parse(todo_data);
  for (let i = 0; i < todo_data.length; i++) {
    var todo = todo_data[i];
    display_todo(todo.todo_id, todo.title, todo.finished);
  }
}
```

Don't forget to call this from the document.ready event, so that it runs on page refresh. We will also have to do some minor edits in all the other functions to fix the bugs.

So there it is, our final app! It holds the whole data even when you close the page, and all the data will be right back to where it was when you open it again! Check out all the code on [github](http://github.com/kartikay26/todo) and try implementing something similar yourself to understand everything.
