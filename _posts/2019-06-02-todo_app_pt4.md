title: How to make a Todo App? (part 4 -- React)
---

# React

In this post, we'll take a look at how to use React to make our application in a modular way. At first I was going to make this post about NodeJS and MongoDB but I decided to go straight to react, because we already have a working flask backend and using NodeJS to do the same thing again would be pretty boring.

I'm going to present a really simple view of react, not going very far in the details. I will not even be using `npm` or `create-react-app`. We'll use react simply as a frontend library the same way we use JQuery and see how we can write code using react.

## What exactly does React do?

The main purpose of React is to allow a web developer to create *Reusable Components*  which are a lot like custom HTML tags, that can do stuff by themselves. For example our todo app could have a `<TodoListDisplay>` component that takes a list of todo objects and from it, creates a list of `<TodoItem>` components within a `<ul>` tag. Each of these `<TodoItem>` components renders itself using html tags like this

```html
<li>
    <div class="todo">
        <span class="todo-title">
            [[text (title) here]]
        </span>
        <input type="checkbox" class="todo-check"/>
    </div>
</li>
```

React gives us a neat syntax to create these components. Using latest Javascript features, we can create the `<TodoItem>` component as if it was a normal function returning some HTML code, somewhat like this:

```jsx
function TodoItem (props){
    return (<li>
                <div className="todo">
                    <span className="todo-title">
                        {props.todo.title}
                    </span>
                    <input type="checkbox" className="todo-check"/>
                </div>
            </li>);
}
```

React also allows us to create components that actually do something. These are called Stateful components and are created using classes instead of functions. This means that we do not have to code in an imperative style, where we find the element to change and change it ourselves. We can now simply change the whole state of a component, and React will itself update all the changed parts for us.

As an example, let us say we created a component called `<TodoListDisplay>`. The state of this component would be the JSON object holding all the todos. When we want to add a new todo or change one of them, instead of finding the right element and changing its value, we simply replace the JSON object with the new one. Then the `<TodoListDisplay>` will re-render itself, and show all the changed values.

React itself takes care of the rendering part of each component. We used an approach similar to this in the last part, but we were re-rendering whe whole list every time, which was quite inefficient! Had we been building a large app, it would have become very slow. React solves this problem by creating a *Virtual DOM*[^1], which is fast and can be re-rendered every time, and it compares the new Virtual DOM and the old one, and updates only the changed pieces in the real DOM. This makes it fast and efficient.

## Initial setup

So right now let us just copy the page we built for the jquery version into a new folder and delete all the JavaScript and HTML we have so far. We'll add a script tag and link it to another file, `main.jsx`. Just before this we'll include two thnigs, React and Babel. The `main.jsx` script needs to have `type="text/babel"` instead of the default `type="text/javascript"`.

```html
<!-- react -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<!-- babel -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
<!-- our script -->
<script src="main.jsx" type="text/babel"></script>
```

However it's not going to be able to run like this, because it needs a dummy HTTP server to be hosted on. To do that, you can either use python's `SimpleHTTPServer` module, or node's `live-server`. Here's how to use them

```bash
#  ... using python ...

$ cd todo/v2_react
$ python2 -m "SimpleHTTPServer"

```

## What is this Babel?

When we write React code, we prefer to use all the latest features of JavaScript that were introduced in ES-6. Normal browsers support ES5 but not all the features of ES6. Babel is a kind of "preprocessor" or "compiler" that converts ES6 code into equivalent ES5 code, so that every browser can understand it regardless of whether it supports ES6 or not. It also adds another feature called JSX which makes it possible to write HTML-like code inside of JavaScript. Although it looks like HTML, but under the hood it gets converted to a normal JSON object that React can then use. The name Babel itself is a reference to [The Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), which is a story about the origin of languages. Hmmm, interesting choice of name for a language translator!

Note that the way we are using babel is only suitable for development purposes. When you actually want to deploy your app to production, it would be better to use Babel on the server side to compile the code just once and already send ES5 code to the clients, so the app runs faster on their machines.

Here are some of the new features of ES6 that we will be using:

```jsx
// 1. The Arrow function
(x,y) => (z) // equivalent to function (x,y) {return z;}
(x,y) => {return z;} // same, now function body can be multi-line too

// 2. Classes
class ClassName {
    constructor(params){
        this.variable = value
    }
    methods(){
        ...
    }
}

// 3. JSX
// we can write use HTML tags inside of JavaScript
// these are just expressions like JSON objects
function Header(){
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
// inside JSX, we can use {} to enclose a normal javascript expression
// (which can also have JSX inside it ... lol)
function Name(){
    var name = "James Bond";
    return <p> The name's {name.split(' ')[1]}, {name}. </p>;
}
```

## Two kinds of components in react

Just before we dive in, we need to study one more thing. That is, the way we create components in React.

There are two kinds of components, one being the stateless (also called functional) components, and another type called the stateful components. The difference between them is the functional components simply display stuff, they do not store any data inside of them. All the data they need to show is passed from the outside, in a variable called *`props`*. They are implemented as pure functions taking the props object and returning JSX code. A pure function means that the function we write should not have any side effect, such as modifying a global variable or accessing an API. The syntax is:

```jsx
function FunctionalComponent(props){
    ...
    return <stuff></stuff>;
}
```

These `props` can be passed to a component when you write it in JSX just like HTML attributes[^2]. For example,

```jsx
function HelloWorld(props){
    return <font color={props.color}> Hello World </font>;
}

<HelloWorld color="red"/> // will produce <font color="red"> Hello World </font>
```

The other kind, a Stateful component (or a class component) is implemented as a class, which inherits from `React.Component`. Their constructor creates an object called the *`state`*, which contains data associated with the component. It may or may not make use of the props passed to it. The general syntax is shown below.

```jsx
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { ... };
  }

  render() {
    return ...;
  }
}
```

The render method is just like the functional component. It has to return the HTML code to show the component on the screen. It will be called again and again each time the state is changed.

The constructor must first call the parent class's constructor, using `super(props)`. Then it creates a `this.state` object. The state of the component should be immutable, and it is set only once at the beginning in the constructor. After initialisation you shouldn't change the state yourself, but rather call the **`setState`** function from the class methods, which will replace the specified part of the state, and **re-render the component** on the screen.

In the final app we will have a component heirarchy like this. It is important to note that in React, *data normally only flows downward from the top* through props of the components. However, we can use callback functions to get data to flow backwards, like from the input box to the stateful component `TodoApp`.

<center> <img src="/assets/4_components.jpg" width="100%"> </center>

We will later meet Redux, which will allow data to pass from the lower components higher up in the tree,  in a proper, systematic way. It will complete the cycle and allow us to create whatever apps we want.

## The app, finally

Okay, so now lets start making the actual app.

First of all, let's just make a component that says "Hello, World!" and write it somewhere on the screen. The way we do this is, we have to have a root component and all other components go under it. Then we find the "body" tag inside the HTML and we render our root component into it.

So write this code into the `main.jsx` file.

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

window.onload = function () {
    var body = document.body;
    ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld/>, body);
}
```

And ... It works! We get a Hello, World heading in the body. The default chrome dev tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) will only show the h1 tag. But if you install the React Dev Tools, it will now also show our custom components. (Click on the image to zoom in.)

Let us now make the rest of the components. First we create the `TodoApp` component, load it with some dummy data and write the code to pass the data to a `TodoItem` component using a `map`[^3]. We create the `TodoItem` component with the same tags that we used last time. Then we also add a `TodoInput` Component which does nothing for now. Only the way to write the `style` and `class` attribute is changed a bit.

```jsx
function Root() {
    return (
        <div id="main">
            <h1>Todo App</h1>
            <TodoApp />
        </div>
    );
}

class TodoApp extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            "todos": [{"todo_id":1,"title":"first item","finished": false,"timestamp":1558937565},
                      {"todo_id":2,"title":"second item","finished": true,"timestamp":1558937623},
                      {"todo_id":3,"title":"third item","finished": false,"timestamp":1558482704}]
        };
    };
    render(){
        return (
            <div>
                <ul id="todo-list">
                    {/* This next line takes each todo within the state
                            and maps it to a <TodoItem> component */}
                    {this.state.todos.map(todo => <TodoItem data={todo} />)}
                </ul>
                <TodoInput />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

function TodoItem(props) {
    return (
        <li>
            <div className="todo">
                <span
                    className="todo-title"
                    style={ { "textDecoration": props.data.finished ? "line-through" : "" } }>
                        {props.data.title}
                </span>
                <input type="checkbox" className="todo-check" checked={props.data.finished} />
                <small>Added on: {new Date(props.data.timestamp * 1e3).toLocaleString()} </small>
            </div>
        </li>
    );
}

function TodoInput(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <input type="text" id="new_todo" style={ {"display":"inline-block"} } />
            <button>+</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Now our example looks exactly like the Flask one, but the checkboxes don't work and the input doesn't work! Hmm, we'll have to solve that somehow.

## Getting input in React

So first of all, let us try to implement the checkboxes. Create a `change` function in `TodoApp` that does this:

```jsx
change = (id) => {
    var newtodos = [...this.state.todos];
    newtodos[id-1].finished = ! newtodos[id-1].finished;
    this.setState({ "todos": newtodos });
}
```

This function will change the state of a todo given an ID[^4]. Pass it to the TodoItem component inside of the map:

```jsx
.map(
    todo => <TodoItem data={todo} onChange={() => this.change(todo.todo_id)}/>
)
```

Recieve the `onChange` inside `TodoItem` and add it to the `<input>` checkbox:

```jsx
function TodoItem(props) {
    return (
        // ... 
        <input type="checkbox" className="todo-check"
            checked={props.data.finished} onChange={props.onChange} />
        // ...
    );
}
```

What we have created here is called a *Controlled* input. What that means is that even the value of the component is being controlled by the state of a React component. To do the same with the `TodoInput`, we would have to save the text that the user has typed also into some state. Putting that state also into `TodoApp` would not be right as it violates *Principle of Seperation of Concerns*. What the user has typed into the input box should be of no concern to the `TodoApp` class. It is only of concern to the `TodoInput` class, so logically that is the right place to put it. Therefore we will make `TodoInput` a stateful component, and make all the user input pass through its state. Only when the `+` button is pressed, we will send the input to TodoApp.

```jsx
class TodoInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { "text": "" };
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type="text" id="new_todo" style={ {"display":"inline-block"} }
                    onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.text}/>
                <button>+</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    handleChange = (evt) => {
        // console.log(evt.target.value);
        this.setState({ "text": evt.target.value });
    }
}
```

We have also added `value={this.state.text}` so that the written data stays in sync with the state. By commenting out the `setState` line in `handleChange` function, you can see how the input field gets stuck, and no matter what you type in the value doesn't change. This is similar to what was happening with the checkboxes before we added the `onClick` code. Also you should be able to see in the React devTools, how the state in `TodoInput` changes, each time we type some text. So yeah, well ... that's how we take into control the state of an input and make it into a *Controlled Input Component*.

<center> <a target="_blank" href="/assets/ss1.10.png"> <img src="/assets/ss1.10.png"> </a> </center>

Now the only thing that remains is to get this state when the `+` button is pressed and add it to the todos. Here's how we'll do it.

```jsx
class TodoInput {
    
    // change this line in render(){
        <button onClick={this.buttonPressed}>+</button>
    // }
    
    // new method
    buttonPressed = () => {
        this.props.addTodo(this.state.text);
        this.setState({"text": ""});
    }
}
```

```jsx
class TodoApp {
    // ...
    // inside render:
        <TodoInput addTodo={this.addTodo} />
    // ...
    addTodo = (text) => {
        var newItem = {
            "todo_id": this.state.todos.length + 1,
            "title": text,
            "timestamp": new Date().getTime() / 1e3,
            "finished": false,
        };
        var newlist = [...this.state.todos, newItem];
        this.setState({ "todos": newlist });
    }
}
```

<center> <a target="_blank" href="/assets/ss1.11.png"> <img src="/assets/ss1.11.png"> </a> </center>

So finally we have implemented the full functionality of the app, this time in plain React. In the next post, let us take a look at Redux, and how to pass data "upwards" in a component tree properly. Also all the code is on [github](http://github.com/kartikay26/todo) so check it out if you're feeling lost.

[^1]: The DOM is bascially the tree structure of the HTML tags that the browser creates in memory. It has some functions that you use to modify it using javascript like `document.getElementByID` etc. JQuery basically creates a wrapper around the DOM API, to make it easier to use. However the default DOM functions ar slow to use, which is why re-rendering is not a good option.

[^2]: There's also another variable in `props`, called `props.children` that gets automatically passed. It contains all the child elements of the tag. So if we do something like `<HelloWorld> <SomeStuff/> </HelloWorld>`, then `props.children` inside of `HelloWorld` will contain `<SomeStuff />`.

[^3]: The map function takes a function and applies it to all elements of the list. The idea of this `map` is also taken from functional programming. 

[^4]: We need to use the arrow syntax whenever we want to pass a callback function in React, we cannot create it as a normal function. This is because of some unfortunate quirks in the way JavaScript handles the `this` object in classes and functions.
